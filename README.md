# Hi, I’m Kimberly 👋

I’m a recent **Cornell MPS graduate in Applied Statistics & Data Science** with a background in **statistics, psychology, and business**. I enjoy applying rigorous quantitative methods to real-world problems, especially where clear reasoning and thoughtful analysis matter.

This GitHub collects academic and applied work from my time at Cornell.
